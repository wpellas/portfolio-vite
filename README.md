Built in Vite using React and Tailwind.

## Features

### Animate on Scroll

Uses react useEffect with an observer that adds a class to an intersecting object, and removing once not intersecting. Allows the elements to replay their respective animation once they get into the viewport.

### Scroll Snap

Scroll snap in css, using semantic html to wrap the react project in a <main>, with each section marked as a <section>. Ensures smooth animations every time a new section is loaded, regardless of scroll speed.

### Project Cards

Mapped components in react which in turn map respective font awesome icons to visually describe used techs.

### Tailwind

Fully using tailwind with minimal custom css code. Responsiveness achieved mainly through Tailwind.
